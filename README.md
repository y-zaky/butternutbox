# ButternutBox Challenge ðŸ’¡
I was asked to build some UI, and I loved the challenge!

# Features! ðŸ’»

  - [x] Uses React on the front end (create-react-app), with Hooks!
  - [x] Can click outside of modal to close
  - [x] A little animation ðŸ˜ƒ
  - [x] As close to the design as I could (I found that the colours provided seemed wrong), and did not have any pixel perfect sizes!
  - [x] I hard coded in one month of a calender ! Super fun as I'd never done that before
  
    
  # ToDo's ðŸ”§
  - [ ] Write Tests
  - [ ] Improve design
  - [ ] Fix bugs
  - [ ] Allow filtered searches (eg repos made in the last 7 days)
  - [ ] Smarter CSS ? Also figure out how to make a better curve for the closed modal!
  - [ ] Figure out a more modular way for setting the day of the month ðŸ˜…
  

 # Key Learning Takeaway's ðŸ“š
 Thank you for giving me this project. I spent a few hours each day over 2 days to build it. I am grateful because..
  - I have never used CSS grid before, and I really enjoyed making a custom calender for the month of August with it. I just dove straight into doing it rather than finding a react calender modal which may not have suited the design :D. It was really fun !
  - https://imagecolorpicker.com/ A Fantastic resource for figuring out the correct colours!

  - https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow I absolutley loved using this tool to guess the box-shadow from the images I was provided. 

### Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd butternutbox
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
